        <p class="card-text">Optio has one goal in life and that is to tell the truth about all things. But the truth sadly does not all ways equal facts.</p>
        <p class="card-text">How people perceive the truth, and how they understand it, matters in a world where half truths and fake news exist. </p>
        <p class="card-text">To know what people consider true and how they feel about all issues is the first step to know the truth about the human condition and the human mind. </p>
        <p class="card-text">This is a wider card with supporting text below as a natural lead-in to additional content. This content is a little bit longer.</p>
        <p class="card-text">We would like to achieve finding out what the truth is for every human being on the planet but do it in a transparent and open way.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Hope you can join us in this journey!</p>
